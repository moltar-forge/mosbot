# Creating Skills

There are two ways to create and manage skills in MosBot OS: (1) directly creating a skill folder in
the filesystem, or (2) asking an agent to create the skill for you.

---

## Method 1: Directly Create a Skill Folder

Create a skill by adding a folder to the skills directory. The folder name must be in **snake_case**
(lowercase with underscores).

### Location

- **Shared skills**: `/skills/<skill_name>/`
- **Agent-specific skills**: `/workspace-<agent-id>/skills/<skill_name>/`

### Folder Structure

A skill folder contains at minimum a `SKILL.md` file. You can also include optional `references/`
and `scripts/` directories:

```
skills/
└── <skill_name>/
    ├── SKILL.md           # Required: Skill definition and instructions
    ├── references/        # Optional: Reference files for the skill
    │   ├── example.txt
    │   └── template.md
    └── scripts/           # Optional: Executable scripts
        └── helper.sh
```

### Sample Structure

**Shared skill example** (`/skills/code_review/`):

```
skills/
└── code_review/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── references/
    │   ├── review_checklist.md
    │   └── security_patterns.md
    └── scripts/
        └── run_linter.sh
```

**Agent-specific skill example** (`/workspace-cto/skills/architecture_decision/`):

```
workspace-cto/
└── skills/
    └── architecture_decision/
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── references/
            ├── adr_template.md
            └── decision_matrix.xlsx
```

### SKILL.md Format

The `SKILL.md` file contains YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown instructions:

```markdown
---
name: <skill-name>
description: <short description>
---

# Skill Title

Skill instructions in Markdown...

## Input

What the agent should expect as input.

## Output format

How the output should be structured.

## Guidelines

- Specific rules or constraints
- Quality standards
- Edge cases to handle
```

---

## Method 2: Ask an Agent to Create the Skill

You can ask any MosBot agent to create a skill for you. This is useful when you want to collaborate
on skill design or when you need the agent's expertise.

### Sample Prompt

```
Please create a new shared skill called "daily_standup" that helps agents generate
concise daily standup reports. The skill should:

1. Accept input about what the agent worked on yesterday
2. Ask what they're working on today
3. Ask about any blockers or impediments
4. Output a formatted standup report in this structure:

   ### Yesterday
   - Completed: ...
   - In Progress: ...

   ### Today
   - Plan: ...

   ### Blockers
   - (or "None" if no blockers)

Include a references/ folder with a template.md showing example standup reports.
```

### How It Works

1. Send the prompt to an agent via chat (Telegram, etc.)
2. The agent will create the skill folder structure in the appropriate location
3. The agent writes the `SKILL.md` file with proper frontmatter
4. If requested, the agent creates supporting files in `references/` or `scripts/`
5. The skill becomes immediately available to all agents (if shared) or that specific agent

### Tips for Agent-Created Skills

- Be specific about the skill's purpose and desired behavior
- Define the output format clearly
- Request reference materials if the skill needs templates or examples
- Ask the agent to follow naming conventions (snake_case for folder names)

---

## Skill Naming Conventions

| Convention       | Rule                                    | Example                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Folder name**  | snake_case (lowercase with underscores) | `code_review`, `daily_standup` |
| **Skill name**   | Lowercase with hyphens                  | `code-review`, `daily-standup` |
| **Display name** | Title case in frontmatter               | `Code Review`, `Daily Standup` |

- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Keep names concise (1-3 words)
- Avoid special characters except hyphens and underscores

---

## Testing a Skill

After creating a skill, test it by invoking it:

1. Open a chat with an agent
2. Type `/<skill-name>` followed by any required input
3. Verify the agent follows the instructions correctly

Example:

```
/code_review Please review this function for security issues:
function authenticate(user, pass) {
  return db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='" + user + "'");
}
```

---

## Editing and Deleting Skills

### Edit a Skill

1. **Via Dashboard**: Navigate to **Skills**, find the skill, click **Edit**
2. **Via Filesystem**: Modify the `SKILL.md` file directly
3. **Via Agent**: Ask an agent to "Update the `<skill-name>` skill to include ..."

### Delete a Skill

1. **Via Dashboard**: Navigate to **Skills**, find the skill, click **Delete** (trash icon)
2. **Via Filesystem**: Delete the skill folder

:::caution Deleting a skill is permanent. Agents that reference the skill will no longer be able to
invoke it. :::
